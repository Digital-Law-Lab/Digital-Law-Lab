# Introduction

This guidebook contains important information you need to ensure that your PC is set up correctly and that you can complete you work seamlessly, in accordance with the required procedures. It doesn't contain documentation about Docassemble itself.

For quick navigation, you can either use the search box at the top or use the sidebar to the right.

## Overview

If you are new head to [Setting Up](/setting-up). If you want to join our team see [How to join us](./how-to-join.md).

Otherwise, the workflow would be as follows:

1. create a new branch
1. clone the branch to your local PC
1. create a corresponding 'Project' in your Docassemble playground for testing
1. open the cloned folder in your code editor and start coding
1. use `docassemble_playground_manager` to push code from your PC to your Docassemble Project
1. test and run
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
1. make a pull request to main for code reviews and for promotion to production

:::note Remember
if further work is required later, repeat from step 1 and make sure to pull the most recent stable version to avoid merge conflicts.
