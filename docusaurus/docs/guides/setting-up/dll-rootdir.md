# DLL RootDir

We recommend that you store all files related to DLL in a single directory. It is up to you what to name the folder and where to store it. You could put it on you `Desktop` or in `%USERPROFILE%` (normally `c:\Users\[your username]`). It just needs to be in a place you can easily access and won't quickly forget. Of course, you should resist any temptation to put it in your `Downloads` folder (especially if your regularly purge your Downloads).
