At a high level, promoting code into production works as follows:

### Only promote `next` into production
All code to go into production should be in the `next` branch

1. Conduct regression Testing
1. Update docassemble package metadata (in `setup.py` in `setup()`).  Check the following:
  
    1. name - should match repository name (**Note:** the name may not match if the repository has been provisioned according to the [Provisioning a New Docassemble Repository](/guides/provision-new-docassemble-repo) standard
    1. version number - use x.y versioning.  Promoter's call as to which version number to increment
    2. description - make sure it's meaningfulr
    1. long_description
    1. author_email (should be `XXXX@digitallawlab.org`) (**TBC**)
    1. licence - should be `Copyright (c) YYYY Flinders University. All Rights Reserved'
    1. url - should be `https://flinders.edu.au`
