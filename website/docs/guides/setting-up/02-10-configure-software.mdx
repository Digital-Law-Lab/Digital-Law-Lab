title: Configure Software
---
### GitHub
GitHub needs to know who you are.  It needs the email you signed up to GitHub with and your full name.  Use the following two commands (I've used my name as an example)
```
git config --global user.name Mark Ferraretto
git config --global user.email mark@ferraretto.com
```
### Python
We need to install the `requests` module into Python.  Do this at the PowerShell command prompt
```
> py -m pip install requests
```
**Note:** if `py` doesn't work try `python` or `python3`

### PowerShell
We suggest you create a directory where you will store all your repositories.  eg: create a directory called `Software` in your home directory.  You can do this from the PowerShell command line:
```powershell
> cd $home
> mkdir Software
```
