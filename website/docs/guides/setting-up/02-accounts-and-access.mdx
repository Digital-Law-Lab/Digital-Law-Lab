### Accounts
Firstly, we're Google-centric ðŸ‘Ž but that's how it is.  We get more free stuff through Google (such as Drive and API to authenticate) than with other providers (eg: Microsoft).  So, you should use a gmail email address when asked to do so (eg: for GitHub and Docassemble etc)

### GitHub
Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).  If you already have one, you can use that if you like (notwithstanding my comment on Google accounts above)
### Docassemble
* Click on the 'Sign in with Google' button.  This will create a new Docassemble account for you with you gmail address.
  * Do this on both the [development](https://dev.dll.org.au/da/) and [production](https://app.dll.org.au/da/) servers.
* Ask <DisplayAdminData data='github' /> to add you to the Digital Law Lab developers team.

You should be good to go!

### Google Drive
* Send your gmail address to <DisplayAdminData data='github'/> so you can get access to the [Digital Law Lab Google Drive](<DisplayServiceData data='google_drive' />

### Slack
* Ask <DisplayAdminData data='github' /> to be invited to the [Digital Law Lab Slack](https://digital-law-lab.slack.com)
