### Clone the Digital Age repo

* Click on this [Digital Law Lab](https://github.com/Digital-Law-Lab/Digital-Law-Law) link

* Now clone the repo into your new Software directory
  > (hint: you can type `git clone` and then press Ctrl-V to paste in the URL you just copied above)
  ```
  cd $home\Software
  git clone https://github.com/Digital-Law-Lab/Digital-Law-Lab
  ```
### Clone a Docassemble repo
All Docassemble repos start with `docassemble-`.  Find one of those and clone it to your `Software` directory using the instructions above.

### Set up a Docassemble Project
* In your Docassemble Playground, create a 'Project' for the repo you just cloned.  You need one project for every repo you clone.  
* A good idea is to match your Playground Project name with your cloned repo.  So, if your docassemble repo is called `docassemble-PackageName`, then you should call your Playground Project 'PackageName'.
1. Select 'Manage Projects' from here:

2. Select 'Add a new project'
1. Type in the name
1. Click on 'Save'

Now you have your first Project read to go!
