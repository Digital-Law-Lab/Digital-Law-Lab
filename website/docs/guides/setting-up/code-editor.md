# Code Editor

We don't use Docassemble's Playground to edit code. This is because the Playground is too small and also doesn't work so well with Github. Instead, we use a code editor like Visual Studio Code and some custom python scripts to do our editing work and push our code to Docassemble for testing.

## Installing a code editor

The first step is to find yourself a decent code editor - if you don't already have one. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), for its enormous library of extensions and great Developer Experience. You could of course use other options, like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) [deprecated], or even [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) :astonished: (or, use Vim bindings for VSCode - if you want to :exploding_head:).

## Why you need a code editor (or IDE)

### IntelliSense

IntelliSense is by far the most appealing advantage of using a powerful IDE like VSCode. It provides things like auto-completion and error spotting (aka linting), among other handy features.
