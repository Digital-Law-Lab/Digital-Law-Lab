### Code Branching Diagram
```
master
 |
 - next
    |
    --- next_aaaa
    |    |
    |    --- issuenn
    |
    --- next_bbbb
    |    |
    |    --- issuemm
    |    --- issuexx
    |
    --- next_cccc
    ...
```

### Policy

1. `master`/`main` only ever contains the version that is currently in production
  > Only <DisplayAdminData data='github' /> can promote code into `master` and in accordance with [Promoting Code into Production](./promoting-code-into-production)
1. `next` branch is created from `master`.  This contains the next version to be promoted into production
  > Only <DisplayAdminData data='github' /> can promote code into `next` and in accordance with [Promoting Code into Production](./promoting-code-into-production
1. `next_aaa`, `next_bbbb` etc are working branches for each team member.  `aaaa`, `bbbb` should be the GitHub usernames of each team member
    > 1. These are working branches.  Each team member can commit changes freely to their own working branch.
    > 1. Team member may also commit changes to other team members' working branches (but please consult with your team member first!)
1.  `issuemm`, `issuenn` are optional but recommended.  `mm`, `nn` etc are issue numbers as recorded in GitHub.  
    > While team members could work directly on their `next_aaaa` branch, it's recommended that team members create additional branches under their 'next branch` and work on issues there.  This makes it clearer to everyone which issues are being worked on by which team member.
