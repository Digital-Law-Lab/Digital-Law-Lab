title: Code Comments Policy
---

TBC but an outline...

* All `def`s and `class`es should be commented at beginning of class with:
  * What the input parameters are
  * what the return data is (for a `def`)
  * a brief description of the class
* This applies to `def`s and subclasses
* Format of the comments should be in a standard form.  Form is TBC

Otherwise, generally be descriptive as you comment in your code.  Complex logic should
contain an introductory comment before you get into it and then maybe one-liners in the 
code explaining the process

Need something similar for JS comments too
