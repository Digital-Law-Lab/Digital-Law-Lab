title: Milestones and Tags Policy
---
import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'

## Just a Skeleton for now

* A milestone should be created in the Issues for a project
* Milestone naming standard:
  * in principle use semantic versioning
  * we only use major and minor version numbers eg: **v1.1**
* use `vn.n` format.
    * no space between the `v` and version number

## Relationship  between milestones and Tags

* Before being released into production, code must be tagged.
* The tag must be the same as the milestone of the code being released
* if there's more than one milestone use the most recent milestoned
