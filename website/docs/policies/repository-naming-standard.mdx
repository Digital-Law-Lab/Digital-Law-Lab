### For Docassemble Repositories

`docassemble-aaaa-nn-descr`

where:

- `aaaa` is the short name or abbreviation of an organisation (eg: clcsa for Community Legal Centres SA or 'uc' for Uniting Communities)
  - A unique abbreviation should always be chosen
  - use `dll` for Digital Law Lab repositories
- `nn` is a two-digit number starting from 01
- `descr` is a short description of the repo.  Separate words with `-` characters.

Example.
`docassemble-clcsa-01-service-directory` - this repo is for a CLCSA service directory app and is the first app we have been asked to work on for CLCSA

### Code repositories but not Docassemble
`aaaa-nn-descr`

the conventions are the same as above

### Repositories created for individual users (eg: to store working code not related to a project)
`dll-uuuuu-nn-descr` or 
`docassemble-dll-uuuu-nn-descr` (if a docassemble package)

where:

- `uuuuu` is the GitHub username of the user creating the repository
- `nn` is a number starting from 01 (as above)
- descr is a description (as above)

### Other Repositories
`Digital-Law-Lab`
> This is a special repository used to store documentation and utilities used across the organisation
