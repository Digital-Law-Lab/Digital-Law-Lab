### For Docassemble Repositories

`docassemble-AAAAnnDescriptiveText`

where:

- `docassemble-` is the prefix required for any Docassemble package.
- `AAAA` is the short name or abbreviation of an organisation (eg: `CLCSA` for Community Legal Centres SA or `UC` for Uniting Communities)
  - A unique abbreviation should always be chosen
  - use `DLL` for Digital Law Lab repositories
- `nn` is a two-digit number starting from 01
- `DescriptiveText` is a short description of the repo.  No spaces between words.  Use CamelCase.

:::note
1. Docassemble omits the `docassemble-` part of a package name when referring to package names.
In this manual we also follow that convention.  When we refer to a 'package name' we mean the part of
the repo name that appears after `docassemble-`.
1. Docassemble only allows upper and lowercase letters and numbers (ie: `[A-Za-z0-9]` to be part of a pacakge name. 
1. A package name can only start with a letter (ie: `[A-Za-z]`)

#### Example
`docassemble-CLCSA01ServiceDirectory` - this repo is for a CLCSA service directory app and is the first app we have been asked to work on for CLCSA.

### Code repositories that are Not Docassemble Packages
`AAAAnnDescriptiveText`

the conventions are the same as above.  This is not required but we do it for consistency.

### Repositories created for individual users (eg: to store working code not related to a project)
`DLLuuuuunnDescriptiveText` or 
`docassemble-DLLuuuunnDesciptiveText` (if a docassemble package)

where:

- `uuuuu` is the GitHub username of the user creating the repository
- `nn` is a number starting from 01 (as above)
- `DescriptiveText` is a description (as above)

#### Examples
- `DLLmferrare01TestRepo`
- `docassemble-DLLmferrare02TestDAPackage`

### Other Repositories
`Digital-Law-Lab`
> This is a special repository used to store documentation and utilities used across the organisation
