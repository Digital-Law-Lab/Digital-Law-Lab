title: Slack Channel Standard
---
This standard governs how Slack channels should be named.

## When to Create a Slack Channel

### Docassemble Packages
Generally, there should be a channel created for each Docassemble package
that gets created.

Slack channel names should be as similar as possible to their corresponding Docassemble package name.

### Repositories that are Not Docassemble Repositories
Where a repo is created for a client or some external-facing purpose then a corresponding Slack
channel should be created.

Other repositories, such as repos created by users for their own use, do not need to have a 
Slack channel created for them

## Slack Channel Naming Standard

### Docassemble channels
The idea is to stay as close as possible to the [Repository Naming Standard](./repository-naming-standard)
while making allowances for Slack naming syntax (eg: no upper-case names).

`aaaanndescriptivetext`

where:

- `aaaa` is the lower-case equivalent of `AAAA` part of the Docassemble pacakge name
(as per the [Repository Naming Standard](./repository-naming-standard));
- `nn` is the same as `nn` for that Docassemble repository; and
- `descriptivetext` is the lower-case equivalent of `DescriptiveText` for that Docassemble repository.

### Channels for Repositories that are not Docassemble Packages
Same as above

### Repositories for individual users
Follows the appropriate part of the [Repository Naming Standard](./repository-naming-standard)
but with the relevant parts in lower case

#### Example
`dllmferrare01testrepo`

would be the name of the Slack Channel for the `DLLmferrare01TestRepo` repository
mentioned in the [Repository Naming Standard](./repository-naming-standard).

### Digital-Law-Lab Repository
The Slack channel for the `Digital-Law-Lab` repository is `digital-law-lab` (ie:
the hpyen characters are retained for this repo).
